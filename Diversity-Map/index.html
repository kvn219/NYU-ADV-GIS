                    Over the past 30 years, an phenomenon has taken shape in education systems in the United States: public schools have become increasingly racially segregated, despite rising levels of national diversity. While previous studies link greater diversity to better student performance, the focus remains largely on diversity in the classroom.<br/>

                <br/>We believe the discrepancy of diversity experienced in oneâ€™s surroundings versus the classroom - is an important
                factor in educational performance. Using the census data on population origin by census tracts across New York State, this map
                visualizes diversity as measured with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index ">Diversity Index</a> or
                better known as the Blau's Index. In sociology, psychology and management studies the index is often known as Blau's Index,
                as it was introduced into the literature by the sociologist Peter Blau.  <a href="https://github.com/kvn219/NYU-ADV-GIS/blob/gh-pages/Diversity-Map/README.md">Next lets look at the impact of the differences between school and communtiy diversity.</a>
